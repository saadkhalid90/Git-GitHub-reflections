We initialize a git repository so that we can track the changes made to the set
of files within the directory.

Staging area gives slightly more control over what files/ changes we need to
commit within a repository. So we can choose ourselves which changes we have
made need to be committed

Make a random change to test commit

Staging area can be used to stage only the changes we want to commit even if we 
have made more than one change in different files within our working directory. 
So, this can help us make one commit per logical change
