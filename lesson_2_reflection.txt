We initialize a git repository so that we can track the changes made to the set
of files within the directory.

Staging area gives slightly more control over what files/ changes we need to
commit within a repository. So we can choose ourselves which changes we have
made need to be committed

Make a random change to test commit

Staging area can be used to stage only the changes we want to commit even if we 
have made more than one change in different files within our working directory. 
So, this can help us make one commit per logical change

Possibly, if we want to create different versions of the same original project, 
we can update changes on different branches

Git branch diagrams can help us visualize the commits and their relations to 
other commits (whether the commits are parents or branches etc). We can trance 
the reachable commits (which are displayed by the git log command)

adding random shit in the test branch â€”

now reverting back to master to test the git log graphing feature

Automatic merge is convenient but on the other hand can be problematic if there are conflicts within the branches being merged. Manual mergers on the other hand may be slightly annoying but can solve problems related to conflicts as they can be manually 
dealt with
