When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I think using remote repositories really makes the collaborative process between 
developers much more convenient 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because many local commits may be experimental and I may not want all those commits 
to be on my remote repository or shared with my collaborators.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks can be used if we want to clone a remote repository onto our GitHub so that 
we may be able to work on it. Clones on the other hand can be useful if I want to 
create a local copy of a remote repository of some kind. Finally branches can be 
used to make local commits, usually for experimental purposes or for adding new 
features. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
